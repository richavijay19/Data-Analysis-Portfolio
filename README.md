# Data-Analysis-Portfolio
My Data Analytics portfolio includes brief introduction to all my five Projects with details of all the key skills learned and executed successfully.

Working on those five projects, I performed many operations related to data analysis and learned to use Excel, Tableau, SQL, and Python for this purpose.

Data analytics is a fascinating field of work and my goal is to expand my knowledge and skills for future
projects.
